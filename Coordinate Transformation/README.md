# Coordinate Transformation Project

A project that transforms geodetic coordinates to geocentric coordinates and vice versa, useful for Air Navigation. 
The algorithm is based on the article "Direct transformation from geocentric coordinates to geodetic coordinates", by H. Vermeille.

## Instructions

Enter the values for equatorial radius and eccentricity, choose a conversion type and enter the respective input values. 
Click on SOLVE to get the solution and RESET to clear all data. 

## Versions

Version 1.0. - It had an error in equation n of the function Geod2Geoc.

Version 1.1. - Current version, with Geod2Geoc fixed.

PyVersion is similar to version 1.1, except that the first was developed in portuguese using Python. 

Future Versions - Edit the CSS file to fix problems with page resizing.
